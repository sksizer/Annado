# Rendering performance — Inbox & list views

## Root causes

The list is slow for three **compounding** reasons:

1. **No virtualization** — all ~3000 tasks mount into the DOM at once
   (`TaskList` → `ProjectGroup` → `DraggableTaskItem` → `TaskItem`). The
   "Show N more" cap does not apply to the inbox's no-project bucket because that
   group defaults to expanded.
2. **A re-render storm** — every row subscribed to the whole `selectedTaskIds`
   array and `expandedTaskId` via `usePanelState()`. Selecting/expanding one task
   produced a new array reference and re-rendered **all** rows (and `TaskList`).
   `React.memo` on `TaskItem` does not help — it only catches *prop* changes, not
   hook-subscription changes.
3. **Each row is heavy** — a *collapsed* `TaskItem` runs ~20 hooks including two
   `useWikilinkSuggest()` calls, `detectDateHint()`, and the full title/notes/
   subtask editing machinery — none needed until the row is expanded.

Secondary costs: ~3000 dnd-kit `useDraggable` registrations; `getFilteredTasks()`
returns a fresh array each render and `groupTasksByProject` runs inline every
render.

## Fix series (additive order)

| PR | Branch | Fix | Status |
|----|--------|-----|--------|
| 1 | `list-performance-primitive-selectors` | Per-row primitive selectors — kill the re-render storm | ✅ |
| 2 | `list-performance-memoization` | Memoize filtered/grouped tasks | ✅ |
| 3 | `list-performance-split-expanded-row` | Split collapsed row from expanded editor (+ hoist shared Sets) | ✅ |
| 4 | `list-performance-virtualize` | Virtualize with `@tanstack/react-virtual` | planned |

### PR1 — primitive selectors (this branch)

`usePanelState()` no longer exposes `selectedTaskIds` / `expandedTaskId`. It keeps
navigation state + stable actions, so it re-renders only on navigation. A new
`usePanelTaskState(taskId)` returns `isSelected` / `isSoleSelection` /
`isExpanded` as primitives, so selecting or expanding a task re-renders only the
affected rows. `TaskList` now subscribes to `tasks` / `completingTaskIds`
directly to keep the list fresh after edits and completions (it previously
refreshed only as a side effect of `expandedTaskId` changing on collapse).

### PR2 — memoize filtered & grouped tasks

`getFilteredTasks()` returned a fresh array every render and the project/logbook
grouping ran inline on every render, so any `TaskList` re-render (after PR1:
data changes, navigation, side-panel toggle, calendar updates) re-filtered and
re-grouped all ~3000 tasks. Now the filtered `tasks` is memoized on its real
inputs, and `dayTasks` / `eveningTasks` / `groupedTasks` / `eveningGrouped` /
`logbookGroups` are `useMemo`s derived from it — moved above the early returns to
satisfy the rules of hooks. Referentially-stable grouped arrays also set up the
later virtualization work. (Shared-`Set` hoisting moved to PR3, which restructures
the row internals anyway.)

### PR3 — split collapsed row from expanded editor

A *collapsed* `TaskItem` previously ran ~20 hooks — two `useWikilinkSuggest()`
calls, `detectDateHint()`, the title/notes/subtask editing state, and several
effects — none needed until expanded. Now:

- `TaskItem` is a thin wrapper that reads this row's selection/expansion state
  and drives the collapse animation, then renders either `CollapsedTaskRow` (no
  editing hooks) or `ExpandedTaskCard`.
- `ExpandedTaskCard` (new) owns the entire editing experience — title/notes
  state, wikilink suggestions, date-hint detection, subtask adder, pickers, save
  and click-outside — and is mounted only while a row is expanded (one at a
  time).
- Person/project name `Set`s are built once per list and shared via
  `WikilinkNamesContext`, instead of being rebuilt per row.

Because the detail wrapper now mounts on expand (rather than always being
present), `ExpandedTaskCard` animates open by rendering at `0fr` and flipping to
`1fr` on the next animation frame; `TaskItem` keeps it mounted ~200ms during
collapse so the close animation still plays.

**Manual test checklist** (no automated UI tests cover this):
expand/collapse animation, title autofocus on expand, click-outside saves &
collapses, ⌘S/⌘D open the When/Deadline pickers, Enter collapses, keyboard nav
keeps the selected row in view, and the check-off linger animation.

## How to measure

Use the React DevTools Profiler against a vault of ~3000 tasks: record (a) initial
mount, (b) selecting a task, (c) expanding a task. Before PR1, a single selection
commits ~3000 `TaskItem` renders; after PR1 it should commit ~2 (the newly- and
previously-selected rows).
