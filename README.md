# Annado

A clean task manager for macOS that lives on (?) your Obsidian vault, or markdown files. No proprietary database, no lock-in, it's all based on your own files. Designed with Obsidian in mind, but also works as a stand-alone app or on your folder with markdown files. 

![Today view](docs/images/today.png)

## The Idea

Your tasks stay as plain markdown in your Obsidian vault. Annado reads and writes standard checkbox syntax with inline metadata, giving you a polished native desktop UI while your data stays portable. Open the same vault in Obsidian and your tasks are right there.

Bilingual: supports Dutch and English for natural language date input.

## How It Works

Annado treats your Obsidian vault as its database. It scans every `.md` file for markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), parses inline annotations like `@when(...)`, `@due(...)`, and `[[WikiLinks]]`, and presents them in a task manager UI. Every edit you make in Annado is written straight back to the markdown files — no syncing, no export step, no sidecar database.

See it in action — capturing a task in an Obsidian daily note during a meeting, then editing it in Annado:

## Views

Annado has 12 views, each accessible from the sidebar or via keyboard shortcut:

| View | Shortcut | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| **Inbox** | `Cmd+1` | Unscheduled tasks awaiting processing |
| **Today** | `Cmd+2` | Tasks scheduled for today |
| **Agenda** | `Cmd+3` | Day/week timeline with drag-to-schedule |
| **Upcoming** | `Cmd+4` | Tasks scheduled for future dates |
| **Anytime** | `Cmd+5` | Flexible-time tasks with no specific date |
| **Someday** | `Cmd+6` | Backlog and long-term tasks |
| **Logbook** | `Cmd+7` | Completed tasks history |
| **Recurring** | `Cmd+8` | Recurring task templates and instances |
| **Wrapped** | `Cmd+9` | Spotify Wrapped-style year-in-review |
| **Added Today** | `Cmd+0` | Tasks created today |
| **Review** | `Cmd+R` | Guided 5-step weekly review workflow |
| **Smart Lists** | sidebar | Custom-filtered task collections |

## Task Syntax

Annado reads and writes this inline markdown format:

```markdown
- [ ] Task title @when(tomorrow) @time(09:00) @duration(1h30m) [[Project]] !(1) #tag @due(2025-03-01)
    Notes go here, indented 4 spaces
    - [x] Checklist sub-item
```

| Field | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `@when(...)` | `@when(tomorrow)` | Scheduled date |
| `@time(...)` | `@time(09:00)` | Scheduled time (used by Agenda) |
| `@duration(...)` | `@duration(1h30m)` | Estimated duration |
| `@due(...)` | `@due(2025-03-01)` | Deadline |
| `!(1-3)` | `!(1)` | Priority (1 = highest) |
| `#tag` | `#work` | Tag |
| `[[WikiLink]]` | `[[Project Name]]` | Project or person link |
| `@recurring(id)` | `@recurring(abc123)` | Recurring template reference |
| `@created(date)` | `@created(2025-02-14)` | Creation date |
| `@completed(date)` | `@completed(2025-02-16)` | Completion date |

Checklist sub-items (`- [ ] sub-task`) can be toggled directly in Annado — the change persists to the markdown file.

## Scheduling

### Natural Language Dates

Type dates in plain language in any date picker. Both English and Dutch are supported:

| Category | English | Dutch |
|---|---|---|
| Keywords | `today`, `tonight`, `tomorrow`, `anytime`, `someday` | `vandaag`, `vanavond`, `morgen`, `overmorgen`, `altijd`, `ooit` |
| Relative | `this weekend`, `next weekend`, `next week`, `next month`, `end of week`, `end of month` | `dit weekend`, `volgend weekend`, `volgende week`, `volgende maand`, `eind van de maand` |
| Weekdays | `friday`, `fri`, `next monday` | `vrijdag`, `vr`, `volgende maandag` |
| Offsets | `in 3 days`, `in three weeks`, `in a week` | `over 3 dagen`, `over twee weken`, `over een week` |
| Explicit | `2026-12-25`, `25/12`, `feb 14`, `march 15 2027` | `25-12`, `22 mei`, `15 maart 2027` |

Offsets accept digits or spelled-out numbers up to twelve. Partial dates roll forward: typing `22 mei` in June resolves to next year's May 22. While typing, the picker shows ranked suggestions, and quick-select chips (Today, Tomorrow, This Weekend, Next Week) are always one click away.

![Date picker with quick-select chips and natural language input](docs/images/date-picker.png)

### Date Hints in Titles

Annado also spots dates in the task titles you type. Write "Call Lena friday" in Quick Add and a banner offers to schedule the task for Friday — accept it and the date is set with the title cleaned up to "Call Lena". Prefix the phrase with `by`, `due`, `before` (or `voor` / `uiterlijk` in Dutch) and it's offered as a deadline instead: "Submit taxes by tomorrow" → deadline tomorrow, title "Submit taxes".

![Title hint suggesting a start date](docs/images/date-hint-when.png)

![Title hint suggesting a deadline](docs/images/date-hint-deadline.png)

### When Values

The `@when(...)` field accepts:
- `inbox` — no schedule (appears in Inbox)
- `today` — scheduled for today
- `evening` — this evening
- `tomorrow` — scheduled for tomorrow
- `anytime` — flexible timing
- `someday` — backlog
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — specific date

### Deadlines

Tasks can have a separate deadline (`@due(...)`), independent of their scheduled date. Deadlines show countdown labels and urgency color-coding in the UI.

---

## Projects, People & Tags

### Projects

- Each `.md` file in your configured projects folder becomes a project.
- Nest folders to create hierarchy — child projects inherit the parent folder's color.
- Assign tasks via `[[Project Name]]` wiki-links.
- Project metadata (description, deadline, start date, ranking, related people, milestones) can be set in the file's YAML frontmatter.
- Projects are color-coded and drag-to-reorder in the sidebar.
- The sidebar shows task counts per project (toggleable in Settings).

![Project page with description, milestones, and linked people](docs/images/project-milestones.png)

### Areas

If you prefer folder-based grouping over explicit links, configure an **Areas pattern** (Settings → Folder Paths). Tasks without a `[[Project]]` link are then grouped by the matching folder they live in.

### People

- Each `.md` file in your configured persons folder becomes a contact.
- Link tasks to people via `[[Person Name]]` wiki-links.
- Person metadata (organisation, relationship, languages) is read from YAML frontmatter.

![Person page with metadata and linked tasks](docs/images/person-page.png)

### Tags

- Add tags with `#tagname` in the task line.
- Tags are color-coded (colors persist per tag, customizable by right-clicking).
- Filter the current view by clicking a tag in the sidebar.

![Tag sidebar with counts](docs/images/sidebar-tags.png)

### Priority

Three levels: `!(1)` high · `!(2)` medium · `!(3)` low. Filter or create Smart Lists based on priority.

---

## Smart Lists

Smart Lists are saved custom filters, accessible from the sidebar with a custom emoji icon. Each Smart List can filter by any combination of:

- **View**: Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Anytime, or Someday
- **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
- **Deadline**: has a deadline / no deadline
- **Due within**: N days / weeks / months
- **Projects**: one or more specific projects
- **Person**: a specific contact
- **Tag**: a specific tag
- **Age**: older than N days

Create a Smart List via the `+` button in the sidebar Smart Lists section, or by pressing `Cmd+Shift+L`. Right-click a Smart List to edit or delete it.

![Smart List editor with combined filters](docs/images/smart-list-editor.png)

---

## Recurring Tasks

Recurring tasks are defined as template files in your configured recurring-templates folder. Each template specifies:

- **Title** and optional notes
- **Recurrence type**: Fixed interval (every N days/weeks/months/years) or After completion (reschedule N days after marking done)
- **Start date**, project, and priority

The **Recurring** view (`Cmd+8`) shows all templates. Click a template to see its pending instances. Instances are generated automatically from the template definition.

Create or edit templates via `Cmd+Shift+R` or the `+` button in the Recurring view.

![Recurring task editor with fixed-interval and after-completion modes](docs/images/recurring-editor.png)

---

## Agenda

The Agenda view (`Cmd+3`) is a time-blocking timeline:

![Agenda week view with time blocks, calendar events, and work schedule](docs/images/agenda-week.png)

- **Day and Week** subviews (toggle in the top bar)
- **Current-time line** shows where you are in the day
- **Drag tasks** onto a time slot to schedule them at a specific time
- **Resize task blocks** to adjust duration
- **Unscheduled tasks panel** on the side — drag into the timeline or use Auto Schedule
- **Auto-scheduling**: places unscheduled tasks into available gaps respecting your work schedule, breaks, and blocking calendar events
- **Reschedule suggestions**: when you drag a task off its slot, Annado suggests the next 3 available slots across upcoming days
- **Calendar events** overlay inline (all-day events at the top, timed events in the timeline)
- **Calendar blocking**: mark specific calendars as "blocks auto-scheduling" in Settings so events are treated as busy time

Set a task's time with `@time(HH:MM)` or by dragging it to a slot. Set duration with `@duration(...)` or by resizing the block.

---

## Review

The Review workflow (`Cmd+R`) walks you through a structured 5-step weekly review:

1. **Process your inbox** — review and schedule unscheduled tasks
2. **Handle overdue tasks** — reschedule or complete tasks past their scheduled date
3. **Review stalled tasks** — tasks that haven't moved in a while
4. **Quiet projects** — projects with no recent activity
5. **Coming up next week** — a preview of what's scheduled next week

Each step shows a progress bar and task cards with inline actions (schedule, complete, delete, open in Obsidian). Use number keys `1–4` for quick actions within each step.

![Weekly Review processing the inbox](docs/images/review.png)

---

## Wrapped

The Wrapped view (`Cmd+9`) is a Spotify Wrapped-style year-in-review. Select a time period (week, month, or year) and step through a deck of animated slides (which ones appear depends on your data):

![Wrapped year heatmap slide](docs/images/wrapped-heatmap.png)

1. **Intro** — total completions with creation and completion rate stats
2. **Big Number** — your headline completion count with count-up animation
3. **Heatmap** — completion activity over time, GitHub-style
4. **Bar Chart** — completions by time period (week/month)
5. **Area Distribution** — how your work spread across folder areas
6. **Project Focus** — top projects by completions with momentum indicators
7. **Task Age** — how long it took you to complete tasks (buckets)
8. **Comparison** — this period vs the previous one
9. **Contrast** — longest task to complete vs oldest open task
10. **Personality** — your productivity personality type with supporting stats
11. **Look Ahead** — upcoming open tasks and key deadlines
12. **Outro** — summary with top projects

---

## Quick Add & Quick Find

### Quick Add (`Cmd+N`)

Rapid task capture from anywhere in the app. Respects the current view context (e.g., opening Quick Add in a project view pre-fills that project). Supports all inline annotations and date hints in titles.

**System-wide**: `Cmd+Shift+Space` opens Quick Add even when Annado is in the background.

**Where new tasks land**: tasks created in Annado are appended to today's daily note, which is created automatically (with frontmatter and a `## Tasks` heading) if it doesn't exist yet. In an Obsidian vault, Annado reads your existing Daily Notes plugin settings to find the right folder and filename format; otherwise the folder and format configured in Settings → Folder Paths are used.

![Quick Add with scheduling, project, priority, and duration controls](docs/images/quick-add.png)

### Quick Find (`Cmd+F` or type any letter)

Universal search across tasks, projects, people, views, and tags. Shows recent items when empty. Results update as you type.

![Quick Find searching across tasks and people](docs/images/quick-find.png)

---

## Bulk Operations

Multi-select tasks with `Cmd+Click`. When multiple tasks are selected, a bulk-action toolbar appears at the bottom of the list:

- **Complete** all selected tasks
- **Delete** all selected tasks
- **Move to Project** — reassign all selected tasks
- **Change When** — reschedule all selected tasks
- **Change Deadline** — set deadline on all selected tasks
- **Change Priority** — set priority on all selected tasks

![Bulk-action toolbar with multiple tasks selected](docs/images/bulk-actions.png)

---

## Side Panel

Open a second, independent task view alongside the main view with `Cmd+\`. The side panel:

- Has its own view selection, filtering, and task selection state
- Supports drag-and-drop **from** and **to** the main panel
- Is resizable by dragging the divider
- Remembers its width across sessions

![Today in the main panel with the Inbox open beside it](docs/images/side-panel.png)

---

## Obsidian Integration

- **Jump to source**: click the Obsidian icon on any expanded task to open the source `.md` file at the exact line number in Obsidian
- **Live sync**: file changes made in Obsidian are reflected in Annado in real time (file watcher)
- **Wiki-links**: `[[Project]]` and `[[Person]]` links are parsed and rendered as navigation links in the UI
- **Vault detection**: Annado detects whether the folder is an Obsidian vault (`.obsidian/` present) and adapts — e.g., daily-note settings are read from Obsidian's own config
- **Pick your editor**: jump-to-source can open the system default, VS Code, Sublime, or a custom command instead of Obsidian (Settings → General)

---

## Deep Linking

Annado registers the `annado://` URL scheme for external capture from Shortcuts, Alfred, shell scripts, etc.:

```
annado://quickadd?title=Buy+groceries&notes=Milk,+eggs&when=tomorrow&project=Shopping
```

Supported parameters: `title`, `notes`, `when`, `project`.

---

---

## Notifications & Menu Bar

Annado can remind you about deadlines without you having the app in front of you:

- **Morning of deadline** — a reminder on the day itself (default 09:00)
- **Day before deadline** — a heads-up the evening before (default 18:00)
- **Overdue daily** — a daily nudge listing overdue tasks (default 08:00)
- **Launch banner** — a summary notification when the app starts

All notification types can be toggled individually, each with its own time, plus a master on/off switch and a test button (**Settings → Notifications**).

There's also a **menu bar icon** (toggleable) with a quick task panel, and two system-wide shortcuts: `Cmd+Shift+Space` for Quick Add and `Cmd+Shift+A` to show/focus the app.

![Menu bar quick task panel](docs/images/menu-bar.png)

---

## Excluded Files

Not every file in your vault should be scanned for tasks. There are two ways to exclude files:

**From Settings** (`Cmd+,`) → **Excluded Files & Folders**

Add paths relative to the vault root. A trailing `/` excludes an entire directory; otherwise it targets a single file.

```
Archive/                     ← skip everything under Archive
Templates/Meeting.md         ← skip one specific file
```

**Via frontmatter**

Any file with `annado_exclude: true` in its YAML frontmatter is silently skipped during scanning. Annado writes this automatically when you exclude a file through the UI, but you can also add it by hand:

```yaml
---
annado_exclude: true
---
```

---

## Settings

Open Settings with `Cmd+,`. Five tabs:

### General

| Section | What you can configure |
|---|---|
| **Vault** | View or change the active vault location |
| **Appearance** | Theme — Light, Dark, or System; accent color |
| **Editor** | Where jump-to-source opens: System default, VS Code, Sublime, or a custom command |
| **Tasks** | Default task duration (15m–2h); confirm-before-delete toggle |
| **Sidebar Counts** | Show/hide task counts per view and per project section |
| **Excluded Files & Folders** | Manage the path exclusion list (see above) |
| **Folder Paths** | Project / person / areas / recurring-template folder patterns; daily notes folder and filename format |

![Dark theme](docs/images/dark-mode.png)

### Calendar

| Section | What you can configure |
|---|---|
| **Week** | Week start day (Monday or Sunday); show/hide weekends in Agenda |
| **Calendar** | Toggle macOS Calendar event display; per-calendar blocking toggle |
| **Schedule** | Work days (per day on/off), start/end times, and named breaks with per-weekday selection |

The work schedule drives Agenda auto-scheduling — tasks are only placed in open work hours, avoiding breaks and blocked calendar events.

### Shortcuts

View all fixed shortcuts and remap any customisable shortcut. Click a shortcut row, press your new key combination, and save.

### Notifications

| Section | What you can configure |
|---|---|
| **Menu bar** | Show/hide the menu bar (tray) icon |
| **Notifications** | Master on/off; morning-of, day-before, and overdue-daily reminders, each with its own time |
| **Launch banner** | Summary notification on app start |
| **Test** | Send a test notification |

### About

App info: version, links to the GitHub repository, issue tracker, and the visual tour.

## Vault Structure

Below is an example layout that works out of the box with the default folder patterns:

```
My Vault/
├── Projects/
│   ├── Work/
│   │   ├── Website Redesign.md    ← project with sub-folder hierarchy
│   │   └── Q1 Planning.md
│   └── Personal/
│       └── Home Renovation.md
├── Persons/
│   ├── Alice.md                   ← contact, frontmatter for metadata
│   └── Bob.md
├── Tasks.md                       ← tasks can live in any .md file
├── Daily Notes/
│   └── 2025-02-16.md              ← tasks here too
├── 12. System/
│   └── recurring-tasks/
│       └── Weekly Review.md       ← recurring task template
└── ...
```

Tasks can live in *any* markdown file in the vault — Annado scans them all (minus exclusions). The folder patterns are substring matches, so `Projects` matches `Projects/`, `01. Projects/`, `Work/Projects/`, etc.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install and run

```
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### 2. Select your vault

On first launch Annado will ask you to pick a folder — point it at your Obsidian vault root. This is the only required setup step.

### 3. Configure folder paths (optional)

Annado looks for projects, people, and recurring task templates by matching folder names. Customise these patterns in **Settings** (`Cmd+,`) → **Folder Paths**.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Projects pattern** | `Projects` | Folders whose path contains this string are scanned for project files |
| **Persons pattern** | `Persons` | Same idea for contacts |
| **Areas pattern** | `Areas` | Folder-based grouping for tasks without a `[[Project]]` link |
| **Recurring templates folder** | `12. System/recurring-tasks` | Exact path (relative to vault root) for recurring template files |
| **Daily notes folder / format** | `00. Daily Notes` / `YYYY/MM-MMMM/YYYY-MM-DD` | Where new tasks are written (ignored in Obsidian vaults with the Daily Notes plugin configured — its settings win) |
